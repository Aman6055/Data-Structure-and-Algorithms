Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

//Consider the example of a movie theatre. You are seated somewhere in one of the middle rows. You dont know which row you are in
BUT you do know that you are (1 + whatveer row the guy is in front of you). Keep doing this recursively and you get the answer.

class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if(root==null) return 0;
        //return 1 + Math.max(maxDepth(root.left) , maxDepth(root.right));
        int left = maxDepth(root.left);
        int right = maxDepth(root.right);
        return 1+Math.max(left, right);
    }
}
